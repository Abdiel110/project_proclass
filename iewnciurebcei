*Thesis Statement/Attention Grabber 
I would never wish for such a controversial and mentally draining situation on anyone, but it seems as though many of the people of the U.S., especially those in the Hispanic community, are facing just that. Everyone seems to want the same thing, justice, but not all agree on what exactly needs to be done to receive true justice without letting their emotions, sense, and/or influence get in the way. A tragic situation was made into an opportunity to grab attention for political reasons and now both the family of the victim and the Hispanic community are at the center of the unjust consequences of what has been unfolding.

*Ethos
 In the early morning of February 22, 2024, a 22-year-old named Laken Riley was out jogging in a park when 26-year-old Jose Ibarra tragically murdered her.  Due to the recent decision of President Joe Biden the U.S.A. opened up its borders that connected with Mexico. People have been heavily influenced by what they are hearing politicians, some voted for, say about the undocumented immigrants that are crossing from that border. Politicians, such as Donald Trump, have made an effort to paint those same people in a negative way saying they are “not people” and are “poisoning the blood of our country”. These remarks have only been fuel to the fire that is the open borders, so politicians have used situations like these to highlight their plans for the bills they want to enforce. Former representative George Santos was seen wearing a Laken Riley button, which some would say. He was an illegal migrant” — and accused Biden, who has long been seen as an empathetic leader, of having “no remorse. He's got no regret, he's got no empathy, no compassion, and worst of all, he has no intention of stopping the deadly invasion that stole precious Laken's beautiful American life,” “He was an animal that came in” Trump said.

*Pathos
My heart goes out to Laken's family this situation had to of impacted them emotionally because the Riley family members have invested love and time into her life and education. Lakens father valued his daughter deeply and thought the world would have benefited from her existence, the father also stated in an article that “She had a lot of life left to give to the world“.  A loved one who was abruptly ripped from their lives and their routine without a proper farewell. After losing someone so important and close to you, especially in the manner that Laken Riley did and her sister had these words to say “the best sister and my built-in best friend from the very first second”, an everlasting wound is created that might never heal. It would be easy to understand why this family would have such strong emotions towards the perpetrator and possibly the people around them or in their community. This situation also impacted the Hispanic community as well because people have been shown to let one person’s behavior affect their judgment of others who share the same skin color and origin. This is now what the Hispanic community is starting to fear after this very tragic incident. This problem is so prominent that even the victim’s father has realized what a “storm it’s caused in our country” and how it has “incited a lot of people”. 

*Logos
A 2020 study conducted by Princeton University found that undocumented immigrants in Texas tended to have fewer felony arrests than legal residents. In New York City, which has seen the arrival of 170,000 unauthorized migrants since Texas Gov. Greg Abbott began busing them to the city in April 2022, there has been no surge in crime in that period.
